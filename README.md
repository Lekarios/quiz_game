# Quiz Game With Lekarios

## Description

<br>This is a quiz that tests users knowledge of JavaScript. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I was able to </br>
<br>create a quiz game that gives users 30 seconds to answer 5 JavaScript related questions. Each wrong answer </br>
<br>will subtract 5 seconds off of the alloted time. If the user wins, they will be invited to add their name to the score board</br>
<br>but if they lose, they will not have the opportunity. They will have to play again for a spot on the score board.</br>

## Installation

<br>Right click on index.html</br>
<br>Select "Open In Default Browser"</br>
<br>Once it populates, you are free to play.</br>

## Usage

<br>This code can be used for ideas on how to create a password generator, but if there are any suggestions, feel free to let me know.</br>
